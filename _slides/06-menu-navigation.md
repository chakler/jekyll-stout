With the navigation menu, when you want to mention something about a previous slide in the middle of your presentation, just point at the bottom of the slide and click on the slide needed.

Now you're done and want to continue the presentation, just go ahead and click the "Last Slide" button and you'll be back on track.

Ohh, you can even go back to your creamy head with one click. Just click the "Top" button. (That's what widgets are for, right?)
